# Project Title: Two-Face Flip

## Description:
Developed a coin flip simulation program using Python. The program allows users to simulate flipping a coin, generating random outcomes and displaying the results.

## Technologies Used:
Python, Random Library, String Library, Object-Oriented Programming

## Role:
Designed and implemented the core algorithm to simulate the flipping of a coin.
Ensured the generator produced random and fair outcomes for each flip.
Conducted thorough testing to verify the randomness and accuracy of the coin flips.

## Challenges and Solutions:

### Challenge:
Ensuring the randomness and fairness of the coin flips.
### Solution:
Utilized Python's random library to generate truly random outcomes and performed statistical tests to validate the fairness of the simulation.
